"Functionality in brief":"This program uses python's "socket","threading" and "thread" modules. Using socket module, this script tries to establish a connection to each port in the port range in the given host. If the connection can be established to a port, this program detects that port as an open port. Otherwise that port is discarded as a closed port.",

"Multithreading":"Once the user gives a port range to scan and number of threads for scanning, this program devides the port range into equal sized sub-ranges and assigns them to each thread. Following code illustrates that functionality.",

--------------------------

"How-to-use":"
 - execute:'python phlague-multithreaded-port-scanner.py',
 - then, enter the <Ip> or <host> you would like to scan,
 - and then, type in 'Port range', and the 'number of threads you would like to scan with-. 
 - it will take a moment or two to initially begin scanning- just a friendly notice.'",
